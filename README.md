# Project Road Segmentation

For this project we have a set of satellite images acquired 
from GoogleMaps. We also have ground-truth images where each pixel is labeled 
as road or background. 

Our goal is to train a classifier to segment roads in these images, i.e. 
assigns a label `road=1, background=0` to each pixel.

Evaluation Metric:
